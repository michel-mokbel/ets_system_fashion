 * Optional development hooks.

 * This file intentionally exports no runtime logic by default. Developers can
 * temporarily place console logging helpers or instrumentation here while
 * diagnosing DataTable payloads or modal lifecycle issues. Keeping the file in
 * version control provides a predictable place for such tooling without mixing
 * it into production-oriented bundles.
